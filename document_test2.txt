Hello all. Welcome to today's exploration into the world of contextual rag using Oracle Generative AI. Now, unlike the simple rags prevalent in the market, which merely repeat policies or data, contextual rag stands out by providing a very tailored response based on the user's inquiry in conjunction with the rich reservoir of knowledge it possesses, not only about all your knowledge documents, but even the user's info. So, but what exactly is context? Context goes beyond just information. It includes a variety of factors such as location, age, time of the day, marital status, booking destination, your past actions. It can be anything, any data. It's this deep understanding of context that empowers contextual rag to deliver answers that are just not generic, but highly relevant and personalized. So let's deep dive into this fascinating technology and uncover its potential together. Let me just show you how a normal rag behaves first. So for example, over here, I come and just upload one of the documents over here. And once when I do that, it creates the vector in the backend vectors and everything in the database. And now using a generative AI model, I'll be acquiring some of the answers. Like for example, I just ask, I have a new baby. Can I take leaves? So in this particular case, what will happen is it will just go and read the document. It doesn't have any info or context about the user. So obviously it will just read out the whole document and answer the relevant data based on the question that it has or it possesses. Now, if you see over here, it suggests me a maternity leave as well and also it suggests me is of paternity leave as well. So because it doesn't know anything about me. But now let's try to switch the gears and try to find out what exactly can happen the same thing using the Oracle's contextual rag that we have here that you see we have we have embedded our chat bot powered by the contextual rag. into the HCM screen. But remember, it can be embedded anywhere. Because, you know, in organizations or in large industries, your policies might differ based on the geographies, based on the logged in user, based on the grade of the user, your policies might differ. And you don't you won't be wanting that a person who is logged in in Germany should be able to view policies which are there in UAE. So similarly, you don't want a grade 2 employee should go and check when he asks a question should be answered which are relevant to grade one employees. So thinking in that now if you come over here and I ask the same question. I have a new baby. Can I take leaves? Now in this particular case, what will happen is when I ask the same question, the contextual rag not only reads the leaf policy document, but also checks from Oracle Fusion in this case, which can be anything in the backend, whether the person asking is a male or not, and then creates the answer. Now, if you see over here, based on the information, Xander is eligible for 10 weeks of paid paternity leave. But since in the question I asked, Can I take leaves? Then it also suggests me the other type of leaves which I can avail based on the policy document that is there. And it also gives me the exact link of the policy document where I can go ahead and find out more information from. And if you see over here, it exactly takes me to the paternity leave part where it gives me all the details about paternity leave. Now I can just try out another example over here. For example, can I take 13 days more of annual leave? Again, in this case, based on the question, what will happen is it will first go in the backend and try to check how many leaves have I already taken. Now, if you see over here that based on the document that we have, I am eligible for 22 working days of leave. But since I have taken 15 days of annual leave and also I can carry a maximum of five days from the previous year, which all this information it gets from the annual leave policy that the company has. and then it tries to answer that. So I hope you understand how important context is. Now, let me just show you another example. And this is for from VisionCorp. So VisionCorp has, for example, embedded a chatbot into their page. And when a person comes and opens the bot, the bot already reads who the logged in person is. And this case, it's Xander, who in the backend is a grade two employee. So a great to employ when he comes and asks any question. So let me just try. I want to take a personal loan. In this case, if you see the rag first finds out who the logged in person is, what is his grade and other details that it needs to answer this particular answer. And then it goes and finds out and tells also it finds out how many because that's one of the major points that you must be completing one year of service. So it also finds out all the prerequisites for taking a personal loan. And then it says that, okay, since you are a grade two employee, you can borrow up to 45 ,000 mentioned in those particular table. And then as before, it also gives you the exact link to personal loan part where it only answers about the grade two employee because this logged in user was our grade 2. I can just try out one more example over here for example I say I am looking for a housing loan. and in this case it will only tell me about housing loan details of how much I am eligible for being a great to employee and also tells me other things relate important information and if you see over here first is that a great to employee can take maximum to 85 ,000 and then also it suggests that I have to be into the Emirati of Abu Dhabi to have or be eligible for all these things. So in conclusion what we witnessed how contextual rag powered by Oracle JNI holds immense potential across any industry. You can think of, for example, the airline industry where passengers can receive tailored flight information based on their booking details, membership status and airline policies. Similarly, just think about the banking sector where customers can effortlessly access precise loan details and other banking information without relying on the manual calculations by the bank employees. Contextual RAC seamlessly integrates information from the company policies, the customer profiles, historical data, and all types of data inside the organization. And that way it increases the way or finds out a better way how businesses can interact with their users. With this ability to adapt and personalize responses based on context, contextual rag is truly a game changer, offering endless possibilities for enhancing user experiences and efficiency across any type of industry.
